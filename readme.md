This project serves as our Proof of Concept required for our Integrated Project 3 module of BSc IT year 3, Glasgow Caledonian University, 25/04/2022.

This project represents the possibility that a social platform for GCU can be made. The initial concept for this website is a place where all GCU students can come to 
and engage with one another, using a forum page for communication, an event page for posting interesting things that are happening, and a one-to-one chat function.

As of writing this readme document, we have created the page, with a functional login and registration system, a page where events with pictures and details can
be added, a basic forum page where users can leave their comments, and an account page showing their information. The website does not allow visitors on without
a logged in account. 

For data storage we are using MongoDB and MongoDBCompass. The website is not hosted, and the database is running locally, which can be changed any time.

MongoDB Local requires a local installation of MongoDB, for that the tutorial can be followed here.
